    "## Intro\n",
    "\n",
    "The main objective of this notebook is to show how you can securely interact with a MLflow server using Amazon SageMaker Studio and SageMaker Trainings.\n",
    "This notebook is meant to be used with the SageMaker Studio user profile `mlflow-admin` and the MLflow server created by [this CDK deployment](https://github.com/aws-samples/sagemaker-studio-mlflow-integration.git) since it ensures the user has the right permissions in place to execute the lab.\n",
    "We will train a model in SageMaker, but use MLflow to track the experiments, register the model, and we will then deploy to the SageMaker managed infrastructure the resulting model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pre-Requisites\n",
    "\n",
    "* Successfully deployed the CDK sample in [this repository](https://github.com/aws-samples/sagemaker-studio-mlflow-integration.git).\n",
    "* Access  to the `mlflow-admin` user profile in the created SageMaker Studio domain and use the `Base Python 2.0` image on a `Python 3` kernel.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Machine Learning Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we will solve a regression problem which aims to answer the question: \"what is the expected price of a house in the California area?\".\n",
    "The target variable is the house value for California districts, expressed in hundreds of thousands of dollars ($100,000).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Install required and/or update libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "At the time of writing, we have used the `sagemaker` SDK version 2. The MLFlow SDK library used is the one corresponding to our MLflow server version, i.e., `2.9.2`.\n",
    "We install the `mlflow[extras]==2.9.2` to ensure that all required dependencies are installed."

See the [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/using-identity-based-policies.html) for more details on creating these.
